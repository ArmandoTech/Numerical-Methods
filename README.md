# Numerical-Methods

Using python to resolve numerical problems related to chemical engineering. 
Libraries such as numpy, sympy and matplotlib are used.

Derivates by analithical method, integrals, Gauss cuadrature, flame heat,
interpolation, fixed point iteration method, Newton's method, Halley's method,
Muller's method, AitkenSteffensen's method, Picard's method, Newton's optimization,
NewtonCotes' method and trapezium's rule are used to resolve the problems.
